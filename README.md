The Node.js weather app is a simple application that fetches real-time weather data using an API and displays it to the user. It uses the Express framework to create a server and handle HTTP requests.

Here's how the app works:

The app starts by setting up an Express server and specifying a port for it to listen on (in this example, port 3000).

It defines a route /weather/:city that accepts a city name as a URL parameter. When a request is made to this route, the app executes the associated callback function.

Inside the callback function, it extracts the city name from the URL parameter using req.params.city.

It then makes an API request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the axios library. The API request URL includes the city name and the API key. The units=metric query parameter is added to get the temperature in Celsius.

Once the API response is received, the app extracts the temperature from the response data (response.data.main.temp).

It sends a simple text response to the client with the temperature information for the requested city.

If an error occurs during the API request or data retrieval, it logs the error and sends an error response to the client.

The server starts listening on the specified port, and the app is ready to handle requests.

To use the app, you would need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up for an account on the OpenWeatherMap website.

You can run the app by executing the command node app.js in the terminal. Once the server is running, you can access the weather information for a specific city by visiting http://localhost:3000/weather/{city} in your browser, replacing {city} with the desired city name.

This is a basic implementation of a Node.js weather app, and you can further enhance it by adding features like a front-end UI, additional weather data, error handling, or integrating with other APIs.
